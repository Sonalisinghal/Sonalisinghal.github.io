I hope this will reach many people and help them keep track of these events. Visit the blogs written by my peers who have had the first-hand experience of some of these. Feel free to contact me if you think something is missing.

## Motivation 
Being in the field of tech can be intimidating for anyone, especially for those who are new and underrepresented. While statistics say that the participation of women in tech is low, many organizations are working hard to make this journey easy for them. There are many amazing scholarships, remote summer of codes, internships, and communities that women can participate in and make their mark in the tech industry. Find some of them here.
